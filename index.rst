############################
Alyvix and Visual Monitoring
############################

Welcome to the official documentation for **Alyvix**.

`Alyvix <https://alyvix.com/>`_ is a **synthetic monitoring system based on computer vision
technology**.  Alyvix simulates real users whose actions you can define, without being hardwired
to any particular application engine.

- Alyvix *automates any application*, interacting with GUIs exactly as a human would.
- Alyvix *measures all UI transactions* and sends the resulting performance data to your
  preferred monitoring system or graphing application.
- Alyvix *creates HTML-based reports* containing fine-grained details of each test case step.

Alyvix provides **guarantees on user perceived quality of IT services**, certifying that users
are able to successfully complete a given application task.
