Alyvix and Visual Monitoring
############################

Welcome to the official Guide for **Alyvix 3.0.0**.

`Alyvix <https://alyvix.com/>`_ is a **synthetic monitoring system based on computer vision
technology**.  Alyvix simulates real users whose actions you can define, without being hardwired
to any particular application engine.

- Alyvix *automates any application*, interacting with GUIs exactly as a human would.
- Alyvix *measures all UI transactions* and sends the resulting performance data to your
  preferred monitoring system or graphing application.
- Alyvix *creates HTML-based reports* containing fine-grained details of each test case step.

Alyvix provides **guarantees on user perceived quality of IT services**, certifying that users
are able to successfully complete a given application task.

==============
What to Do Now
==============

The first step is to check that your system has the minimum system requirements and then
:ref:`install Python and Alyvix <install_release_top>`.

Then if you want to just dive in and get something done with Alyvix, read the
:ref:`Getting Started <getting_started_top>` page.  It will get you up and running
and prepare you to implement Alyvix in your environment.

.. If you want to understand the capabilities of Alyvix more in depth, the
   :ref:`Alyvix Concepts <concepts_top>` page is the place to start.

For more extended examples of specific, real-world use cases that you can build upon to implement
more sophisticated or targeted scenarios, take a look at the :ref:`Tutorials <tutorials_top>` page.

The sections on test cases contain detailed information about using the various Alyvix interfaces
to create and execute them.

For information on how to get in touch with us, as well as with the Alyvix community, the
:ref:`Getting in Touch <getting_in_touch_top>` page has everything you need.  If there's anything
we can do to improve the Alyvix experience for you, let us know!
