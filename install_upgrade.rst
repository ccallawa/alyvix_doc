Alyvix is implemented as a Python package.  Once you check that your system is compatible, the
instructions for installing Python, Alyvix, and its dependencies will guide you through the
installation process.

Note that Alyvix 3 is :warn:`not` backwards compatible with Alyvix 2.

.. todo::

   * Are the v2 RNs released anywhere besides the v2 user guide?  Do we want a blog or other social
     media outlet?
   * Is a changelog appropriate for packages released through pip?
   * "Hide" RNs from more than N releases ago?
