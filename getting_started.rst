Getting Started
###############

Before continuing, make sure you've already :ref:`installed Alyvix <install_release_top>`.

For the tasks in this section, you'll need to run the Windows Command Prompt and switch to
the directory where you want to keep your test cases, e.g.:

.. code-block:: doscon

   C:> cd C:\Users\<username>\Desktop\Alyvix\Testcases\


Once you've gone through the steps for these two tasks, you'll have a pretty good idea of
how Alyvix works:

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. :ref:`Check that Alyvix is working <getting_started_test>` with a minimal test

   * Simple command line test, e.g. with --version
   * Open Start, then launch the settings dialogue

#. A slightly :ref:`more difficult task <getting_started_workflow>`

   * Page with immediate test working instructions

Once you've mastered these Alyvix basics, why don't you try something a bit harder like
a tutorial in our :ref:`Tutorials section <tutorials_top>`?

    in this one file
