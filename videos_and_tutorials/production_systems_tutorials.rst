.. _production_tutorials_salesforce_deep:

.. rubric:: SalesForce Service Console Deep View

Here we show how to visually monitor SalesForce Cloud Edition's Service
Console in depth.  As opposed to the panoramic test case for SalesForce below
which looks at a number of different modules in a shallow manner, this deep test
case looks only at Service Console, but in extended detail.

The test case we construct in the video can serve as a template for building
additional, wide-ranging checks on the availability and responsiveness across
multiple features, with interactive objects like menus, lists, buttons, search
filters, and hover panels.

.. _production_tutorials_salesforce_panorama:

.. rubric:: SalesForce Cloud Panoramic View

This video tutorial shows how you can create a panoramic Alyvix test case to
visually monitor the Sales module of SalesForce Cloud Edition (Lightning).
Given the regularity of the user interface, it uses a loop to checks for functionality,
availability and performance of multiple tasks like Contacts, Dashboards, and Reports
rather than monitoring any single module in great detail.

.. rubric:: SAP Work Items Monitoring

Here we look at how to visually monitor Work Items in SAP under the role of a Solution Architect.
We create an Alyvix test case that uses Solution Manager's existing user interface to try out
a series of interactions.  Alyvix acts like a human user, and since it uses the existing
interface, you don't need to make any changes to your SAP software to use it.
