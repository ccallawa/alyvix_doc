.. topic:: Image Components Video

   This video describes the options available for Image Components and illustrates with an
   example of how Alyvix's logic works when there are multiple similar targets:

   * Match - An exact match of both color and shape
   * Color - Match the main color (within some tolerance) regardless of shape
   * Shape - Matches when the shape is the same, regardless of color

.. topic:: Rectangle Components Video

   The various rectangle component options are demonstrated also using an example showing
   how Alyvix's logic works when there are multiple similar targets:

   * Button - Match a small rectangle within a large space, where that rectangle may float
   * Box - Match a rectangle like a text field that stretches horizontally
   * Window - Match a panel or window both horizontally and vertically

.. topic:: Text Components Video

   This video shows how to use the **RegEx** option for the **Detect** feature of text components,
   using an example tht:

   * Looks for a text string within a defined area
   * Uses a regular expression to find a code embedded in that text string
   * Save that code
   * Insert that code later in a separate location

.. topic:: Component Actions Video

   Here the various mouse actions are shown using Windows Explorer as an example:

   * Simple mouse actions such as Move and Click
   * Hold - similar to a Click but without the accompanying Release
   * Release - letting go after a Hold action was performed
   * Scroll - vertically moving an object's container
