***************************
Designer: Interface Options
***************************

The parameters and settings for Alyvix Designer are divided into:

* :ref:`Test Case Object Options <alyvix_designer_options_test_case_object>`, those which affect
  the entire test case object, like its name and how long to wait before timing out
* :ref:`Component Options <alyvix_designer_options_components>`, which are associated with a
  particular visual component, describing how it should be recognized on the screen and
  interacted with
* The :ref:`String Field <alyvix_designer_options_strings_top>`, a sophisticated component option
  that allows you to compose both simple strings and complex templated strings, and either insert
  them into a GUI component like a text field, simulate a menu action or pressing a special key
