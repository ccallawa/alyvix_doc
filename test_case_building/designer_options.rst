***************************
Designer: Interface Options
***************************

The parameters and settings for Alyvix Designer are divided into:

* **Test Case Options**, which affect an entire test case, like the name of a test case object
  and how long to wait before timing out
* **Component Options**, which affect a specific component type for a group or component,
  describing how they should be recognized on the screen and interacted with
* **The String Field**, a sophisticated component option that allows you to compose both simple
  strings and complex templated strings, and either insert it into a GUI component like a text
  field or simulate a menu action or pressing a special key
