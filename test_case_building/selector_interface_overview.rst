****************************
Selector: Interface Overview
****************************

Alyvix Selector allows you to organize individual :iconlink:`gloss|test case|../glossary.html#glossary-test-case`
copy test case objects from one file to another, and visualize and change basic test case parameters.

When used with :ref:`Alyvix Editor <alyvix_editor_interface_top>` rather than as a standalone
application, it allows you to quickly select test case objects in order to create
:iconlink:`gloss|scripted|../glossary.html#glossary-test-case-script` interactions.

The Selector interface is centered around a list of all test case objects in a given test case,
with a separate tab for each :file:`.alyvix` :ref:`file <test_case_data_format_file>`.
The *primary* tab (the first one opened, with the blue background) is the only file whose objects
can be changed.  Any other *secondary* tabs are used to view and filter their test case objects,
and if desired, to import them into the primary tab.  The values of test case objects in secondary
tabs cannot be changed.

You can start Alyvix Selector as a standalone module from the command prompt (you can find
information about its :ref:`command arguments here <test_case_building_selector_launch>`):

.. code-block:: doscon
   :class: medium-code-block

   C:\Alyvix\testcases> alyvix_selector -f <file-name>

.. _alyvix_selector_interface_screenshot:

This will bring up the Selector interface:

   :class: image-boxshadow image-very-large zoomable-image
   :alt: The Alyvix Selector interface.
   :target: ../_static/targets/as_main_screen.png

The principle interface elements are:

.. rst-class:: bignums

#. The **file tabs** show the primary tab and any opened secondary :file:`.alvyix`
   :ref:`test case files <test_case_data_format_top>`.  Switching between tabs shows the
   :iconlink:`gloss|test case objects|../glossary.html#glossary-test-case-object`
   contained in each file.  A new file can be loaded by clicking on the |plus-icon| button.
   Similarly, the |times-icon| button next to a non-primary tab will remove that tab (note that
   you cannot remove the primary tab).
#. The **list headers** :ref:`categorize the properties <alyvix_selector_interface_headers>` of each
   object, allowing you to sort on some fields and find the details of a particular test case
   object at a glance.
#. The **test case object list** :ref:`shows the principal properties <alyvix_selector_interface_list>`
   (excluding the component recognition and interaction settings) of each test case object, with
   one line for each object.
#. The **list actions** let you quickly select or deselect all test case objects in the list, and
   copy the name of a test case object.
#. The **filtering and search** fields let you select all test case objects with a given
   :ref:`screen resolution <alyvix_selector_interface_grab_resolution>` and scaling factor, or
   that contain a given text string in either the :guilabel:`Name` or :guilabel:`Date modified`
   fields.  The :guilabel:`Search` field uses a non-regex substring search, and the |times-icon|
   action clears this field.
#. The **test case object buttons**, :wbutton:`GRAB`, :wbutton:`EDIT`,
   :wbutton:`DUPLICATE` and :rbutton:`REMOVE` act on the :ref:`currently selected test case
   objects <alyvix_selector_interface_object_actions>` in the list.  The :wbutton:`ADD` button
   will initiate a new screen capture (after a specified :nobutton:`Delay` in seconds) to define
   a new test case object.
#. The :bbutton:`OK` and :nobutton:`CANCEL` buttons will exit Alyvix Selector, either saving or
   discarding any changes, respectively.



.. _alyvix_selector_interface_headers:

=====================
Selector List Headers
=====================

The test case object list headers describe the contents of their respective columns.
The list can be sorted on the first three columns by clicking on the header name, with the
|sort-up-icon| and |sort-down-icon| icons indicating whether the sort order is ascending or
descending.

The list headers have the following characteristics:

* **Name:**  The object name :ref:`assigned to the test case object <alyvix_designer_interface_descriptions>`.
* **Transaction group:**  This is a user-definable field that can be used to group together test
  case objects that have something in common (for instance a "login" group, "response check" group,
  "purchase" group, etc.) and then used for sorting and searching.
* **Date modified:**  The date and time automatically recorded when the test case object was last
  modified in Designer, Selector or Editor.
* **Timeout:**  The timeout value is the number of seconds that Alyvix attempts to detect objects
  onscreen.  If this value is exceeded, then the break flag will determine what happens next
  (note that the *timeout* and *break* parameters can also be set
  :ref:`in Designer <alyvix_designer_options_test_case_object>`).
* **Break:**  If this flag is set, then when the *timeout* is exceeded Alyvix will stop the
  currently running script and switch instead to running the fail script.  If unset, Alyvix will
  instead continue on to the next object if the timeout is exceeded (the relationship between
  *timeout*, *break* and *measure* is
  :ref:`described in further detail below <alyvix_selector_interface_time_measure_break>`.
* **Measure:**  Tells Robot whether or not to output the measurement data of a given step in the
  console output.  When a test case has completed execution, only test case objects whose measure
  flag is set will have their :ref:`timing data <alyvix_robot_result_cli>` included.
* **Warning, Critical:**  The threshold values set for integration with a monitoring system
* **Resolution:**  The horizontal and vertical pixel resolution, and the scaling factor (Windows
  zoom) of the test case object's :ref:`screen capture <alyvix_selector_interface_grab_resolution>`.
* The **Screen** element is a thumbnail of the frame on which that test case object is defined,
  which can be especially helpful distinguishing between them when you have a large number of
  objects in a single file.



.. _alyvix_selector_interface_list:

=====================
Test Case Object List
=====================

This list shows all test case objects contained in the :file:`.alyvix` file corresponding to the
currently selected tab.

The values for many fields in the primary tab can be changed directly without opening Designer.
This can be accomplished by simply clicking on the existing value (or blank space where it should
go), entering the new value, and then either pressing :kbd:`Enter` or clicking elsewhere in the
list.

.. note::

   Remember that in standalone mode, any changes will not be saved until you have exited
   Selector by clicking on the :bbutton:`OK` button.  When used with Editor, changes from
   Selector will be saved when the entire test case is saved in Editor.

All editable fields are *validated* in real time to ensure that only new values of the correct type
can be entered.  When a value is not valid you will see an error message like this:

.. image:: images/as_name_validation.png
   :class: image-boxshadow zoomable-image
   :alt: The Alyvix Selector interface.


.. note::

   The values of test case objects in secondary tabs cannot be changed.

When Selector is being used as part of Alyvix Editor, the |4arrows-icon| and |lineadd-icon| action
icons at the start of each row allow you to
:ref:`add the corresponding test case object to the scripting panel <alyvix_editor_scripting_node_add>`
by using *drag-and-drop* or appending  it to the
:ref:`scripting panel <alyvix_editor_scripting_panel_top>`.  The |play-icon| action will
:ref:`execute that test case object <alyvix_editor_interface_debug>`
as if it were the only scripted element in its test case.

The :kbd:`Shift` and :kbd:`Control` keys work together with the mouse to select multiple rows
in the standard way when using Windows applications.  Selected rows are shown with a light blue
background, and can then be used with the actions described in the next section below.



.. _alyvix_selector_interface_object_actions:

========================
Test Case Object Actions
========================

The :nobutton:`Delay [sec] <n>` control together with the  :wbutton:`ADD` button allows you to
add a completely new test case object by launching Designer directly from the Selector interface
with the specified countdown delay in seconds, just as if you had used Designer's :file:`--delay`
:ref:`option <test_case_building_designer_launch>` from the command prompt.  This action is
available regardless of whether any test case objects are selected.

The :wbutton:`GRAB` button
:iconlink:`video||https://youtu.be/5WWbx3homho?t=281`
allows you to (1) replace the existing screen capture of the current
test case object with a new one from the current interface, or (2) add a new screen capture at a
different resolution.  See :ref:`the section below <alyvix_selector_interface_grab_resolution>`
for a more complete description.

The :wbutton:`EDIT` button appears when only a single test case object is selected.  Clicking on
it launches :ref:`Alyvix Designer <alyvix_designer_interface_overview>` with the currently
selected test case file and object, allowing you to modify that object.

Two other actions affect all test case objects currently selected:

* :wbutton:`DUPLICATE` will create a new test case object(s) from each selected row.  The new
  name(s) will be the same name(s) as the currently selected object(s), but with the string
  ``_copy`` appended at the end.
* :rbutton:`REMOVE` will delete all currently selected test case objects.  A confirmation
  request dialog will appear to make sure test cases aren't accidentally deleted.

When an additional file tab is open, only the :wbutton:`IMPORT` action will appear.
Any objects selected will be copied just as for :wbutton:`DUPLICATE`, except that the new
object(s) are copied to the primary tab rather than to the currently opened tab.

.. note::

   Remember that in standalone mode, any changes will not be saved until you have exited
   Selector by clicking on the :bbutton:`OK` button.  When used with Editor, changes from
   Selector will be saved when the entire test case is saved in Editor.  (No changes will be
   made to any objects in any secondary tabs).



.. _alyvix_selector_interface_grab_resolution:

========================================
Regrabbing and Adding Screen Resolutions
========================================

The :wbutton:`GRAB` button described above has two principal uses, to replace the existing
screen capture with a new one, and to add an additional screen capture at a different resolution
than the existing one.

When the resolution of the Windows desktop matches one of the resolutions recorded in the test case
object, Selector will overwrite that :ref:`screen capture <test_case_data_format_components>`
in the object with the new version.

This replacement allows you to keep a test case up-to-date, which can be useful for times when
a web site or web app has been fixed or updated.  In addition to simple replacement, you can also
use regrabbing to build new test cases faster by using the :wbutton:`DUPLICATE` button to copy
the test case object, and then just changing the screen.

When the resolution of the Windows desktop does not match any of the screen grabs stored in the
test case object, then a grab of the current screen will be added to its existing screen grabs,
annotated with the current screen resolution and zoom factor.

.. note::

   When you regrab a test case object that includes a text component in detect mode with a
   :ref:`regular expression <alyvix_designer_options_components_text_detect>`, the scraped
   expression will automatically be reprocessed under the existing regular expression and the
   new value stored.



.. _alyvix_selector_interface_time_measure_break:

======================================
Interactions - Timeout, Measure, Break
======================================

The user interface elements for *timeout*, *break* and *measure* are described in
:ref:`the List Headers section above <alyvix_selector_interface_headers>`.  Briefly, *timeout*
and *break* affect Alyvix's behavior
:iconlink:`video||../videos_and_tutorials/operations_tutorials.html#operations-tutorials-outputcomposition`,
while *measure* serves to indicate that Alyvix should
:ref:`measure <test_case_execution_measurements>` and :ref:`report <alyvix_robot_result_cli>`
the time until detection at the end of the test case run.  These three parameters can help you
judge availability and responsiveness.

Each application you use with Alyvix will likely have a number of different types of behavioral
and measurement requirements.  Past experience has shown that the following three scenarios are
the most frequent.  Each is suited to a particular combination of these three parameters:

* **Heavy resource usage:**  |halftab| |tmo|:runblock:`high`
  |smalltab| |brk|:runblock:`set`   |smalltab| |mea|:runblock:`set`

  *Examples:* Loading an application, loading a full new web page, or initiating an action that
  results in a search or database request

  This first situation happens whenever you expect it will take some time for an action to run to
  completion.  If that doesn't occur within a certain time limit, then it doesn't make sense to
  continue running the test case.  Steps with potentially large wait times are one of the main
  reasons you are monitoring an application in the first place, so it makes sense to report the
  measurements for steps like these.

* **Light resource usage:**   |halftab| |tmo|:runblock:`low`
  |smalltab| |brk|:runblock:`set`  |smalltab| |mea|:runblock:`unset`

  *Examples:*  Navigating through an application via menus or buttons, entering values in fields,
  or an intermediate check where the timing results are unimportant

  In the second case you may need to perform a series of steps to put the application in a state
  where you can measure what you need.  This may include navigating to a particular interface,
  or adding or changing values in an interface that is already displayed, especially when there's
  no need to worry about network latency or remote resources.  A series of these steps is typically
  followed by a *heavy resource usage* step.  Here the timeout can be low since we don't expect
  each individual step to take too long, and we don't usually need to see the resulting measurements
  (e.g., how long it takes to enter text into a field), but we should still fail if the change
  couldn't be made, since it would not be possible to perform a subsequent measurement step.
  Although you can measure these steps, note that measuring too many will clutter the results,
  especially if you import them into graphical analysis software.

* **Optional actions:**  |halftab| |tmo|:runblock:`low`
  |smalltab| |brk|:runblock:`unset`  |smalltab| |mea|:runblock:`unset`

  *Examples:*  Remove a cookie/popup notice, or put an interface into a standard format

  Finally, you sometimes need to interact with an interface only if a certain condition is met,
  like when there are cookie notices or popups overlaid intermittently on a web page that may cover
  a button you need to press, or an application retains persistent state (especially in a multi-user
  scenario) so that window size or position may differ over time.  Using a test case object that
  looks for them, in conjunction with an |if-false| scripting element and an action that
  standardizes the interface, such as removing a cookie notice or maximizing a window.
