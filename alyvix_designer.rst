   * Need an overview/map of Alyvix Designer and its doc in the Designer intro page
   * Should we talk about "Groups" vs. "Components", or is it better to talk about
     a "Main" component as the head of a group, but otherwise the same?
   * "Guide lines", "crosshair", a different option?
   * Consider using a styled ``:pull-quote:`` in the intro text to grab attention

- Description of Alyvix Designer
- Description of the various pages
